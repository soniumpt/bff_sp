Welcome to BFUO Memories.
Ready to go?
Are you done with the account registration? Then let us get you started! Please, be a little more patient and read all the following text to make sure you dont miss anything as a new player and take advantage of everything we have to offer you!<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>You have already chosen some skills and stats when creating your character, but these won't matter for now because after you click this stone you'll pick the skills again.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>Before picking any skill or stat you must be aware that you can't have more than 100.0 in any skill, up to a 1200.0 total skill cap and also that you can't have more than 120 in any stat either, up to a maximum of 275 total stat cap.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>Now that you are aware of our server skills and stats cap, and as soon as you finish reading this, you can start your journey by double-clicking in the Skills and Selector Stone located nearby your current position to pick your 6 desired skills at 65% and a starter kit.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>The amount you want to raise on a skill through that stone menu can be costumized by manually deleting the default values (marked as yellow) and typing new ones (always making sure you are not going beyond the single and total caps allowed). If you make a mistake picking any skill, do not worry! You can nuke all your skills as many times as you want through that stone menu and then pick the new skills you want.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>Before leaving this area through the gate, please make sure you pick the Starter Kit from the Skills and Stats Selector Stone, which will provide you some useful starting items such as a Reagents, Money, Newbied Dagger and a Spellbook.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>Once you're happy with all of this, use the teleport gate to head to the BFUO Academy, where your adventure begins! Tip: Double click the blue stone when you get there to join the academy.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>Good Luck!

Welcome to The Academy
Ready to go?
Welcome to Trinsic Academy, built and run by the friendly citizens of Trinsic to aid you in training. When you join the Academy you will be given a set of Academy Leather Armor, a shield, some clothing and a spell book. This is all blessed/newbied until you graduate from the Academy.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>The benefits of the Academy include cheaper lessons from the Academy staff and cheaper reagents from the Academy vendor. You also get free unlimited use of the training dummies and archery buttes, without fear of being attacked by anyone.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>To the North of the academy you will find another portal. This allows Academy members to travel to another town or dungeon free of charge. To get back here, you can use the 'Cat Rune' you get on joining, it holds 9 free recalls to come back here.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>Alternatively, you can use .academyhome upon death. It is also free of charge.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK If you are a miner you may consider making your way to Minoc Academy Camp instead of using the sparring facilities here.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>To join the Academy, head over to that blue stone in front of you and double click it. Once you have done that, you can either stay around here or any other Academy Camp (Britain/Minoc) and use the sparring facilities, or make your way to the 'Newbie Dungeon'.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>The Newbie Dungeon in Trinsic has some low level monsters in it, which you can practice with, as well as receive loot from them and gain skill faster by doing so. To get there, head South until you see a hole. Go downstairs and there you are. Don't worry if you die in here, you will be automatically resurrected. In this dungeon, you can also find quests to nearly complete your spell book. They are very easy to be completed and it will get you to know our game mechanics better.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>You can also visit your Academy Profile by double clicking the blue stone located in the Academy Camps.<VAR.BREAK><VAR.BREAK>This should get you started! If you need more assistance please ask on World Chat (!) or visit our forums at www.imperialuo.com/forums
